## Installation

Requires **python3.10** or higher

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To install tkinter on macOS, run the following command:
```bash
brew install python-tk@3.X
```

## Usage

To view all options use python3 main.py -h
```bash
python3 main.py [-m/--max_door_frequency] [-r/--radius] [-s/--seed] [-mz/--maze] [-sc/--scale] [-T/--turns] 
      [-ng/--no_gui] [-p/--player]
```

## Debugging

The code generates a `log/debug.log` (detailed), `log/results.log` (minimal) and `log\<player_name>.log` 
(logs from player) on every execution, detailing all the turns and steps in the game.

python3 main.py -m 5 -r 40 -s 7 -mz "maps/default/simple.json" -ng

maze_state = [[x1, y1, door_type_1, door_state_1], [x2, y2, door_type_2, door_state_2] [x, y, door_type_3, door_state_3]]
